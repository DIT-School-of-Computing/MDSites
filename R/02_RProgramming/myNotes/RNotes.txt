R is a dialect of S
S is a language developed by Bell Labs (1976) internal statistical analysis as Fortran libraries
Early versions did not contain function

1991 - R
Paper in 1996
Ross and Robert, made R free software
Two main mailing lists, RHelp and RDevelop
R even runs on PlayStation 3
Useful for interactive work
Very active user community
Free:
	Doesn't cost anything
	Free Software: 
	Free Software Foundation
	0: To run for any purpose
	1: Freedom to study how the program works, make changes to it yourself, sell changes etc.
	2: Freedom to redistribute, can sell copies
	3: Can improve the program to benefit the entire community
	 
Drawbacks: 
	Based on 4-year-old technology. Little built-in support for dynamic or 3d Graphics
	Functionality is based on community demand. If nobody has seen fit to implement the
	feature that you would like, you have to do it yourself
	Objects you create have to be stored in the physical memory of your computer
	If the objects you create are larger, then you have to deal with that yourself
	Not ideal for all possible situations
	Larger and larger datasets makes a limitation of the fact that the objects must be loaded
	into physical memory.
	
Two Conceptual Parts
1: Base R System
	Base package, all the low-level functionality you need to run the R system.
	From CRAN
	Other packages, utils stats, data sets graphics, fundamental packages
	Other recommended packages, boot, class, cluster, codetools, etc..
	Commonly-used packages
	 
2: Everything Else
	There are alo about 4,000 other packages on CRAN which are user-contributed.
	CRAN has a number of restrictions in order to get a package onto CRAN
	Documentation for all functions, pass tests etc.
	Also packages associated with the bio-conductor project, genomic and biological data analysis.
	
Some R resources
	1: An introduction to R, a long PDF document.
	2: Writing R extensions manual, for developers of packages
	3: RData Import and Export manual
	4: R installation and Administration manual
	5: RInternals manual, a really technical document about the internals of R

Getting Help
	Asking Questions
		Steps to reproduce the problem
		Expected output
		What you see instead
		What version of the product and Libraries are you using
		What OS
		Additional Information
	Subject Heading in Emails, make it very clear
	
	Describe the goal, not the step
	Be explicit about your question
	Provide the minimum amount of information necessary
	Be courteous
	Follow up with the solution if and when you get it resolved
	
	DO NOT claim you found a bug because you can't get it to work
	Don't email multiple mailing lists at once
	Specify where you think the problem is
	
	Example of wasting a cycle of emails and responses by asking such a vague and high-level
	issue, with no evidence that the writer ever made any effort to resolve it themselves
	
	Class discussion board
	R-Help mailing list
	Other project-specific emailing lists	
	
	
Evaluation
	Evaluated and printed
	If the expression evaluates to nothing, then there is nothing to show;
	[1] indicates the first element of the vector.
	If we store a single element object it is still stored as a vector
	
R Data Types - Objects and Attributes
	Basic, atomic classes.
	character, numeric, integer, complex and logical
	The most basic object in R is a  x <- 1:4 , which can be a vetor of consistent object types
	Everything in a vector has to be of the same class.
	The list, is a type of vector that can have objects of different classes
	vector function, class and length
	R treats numbers as double precision types, but you can force it to use integer by using captal L
	1L is an integer, 1 is 1.00f
	Inf is infinity
	NaN is also included
	R objects can have attributes;
		names, dimnames, dimensions, class, length,  other user-defined attributes and meta-data
		Attributes of an object can be accessed using the attributes() function
		
	
Creating Vectors
	c function to create vectors
	c == Concatenate things
	including complex numbers
	vector function can create a vector of a type and length, buy default initialised to 0
	
Vector of mixed objects, coerce the vector to be the class of the least common denominator class
	number and string gives a vector of strings
	numeric and boolean converted to vector of numbers
	letter and boolean is converted to a character vector
	be aware of the coercion that occurs in R
	
	You can explicitly coerce using the as.* functions
	This represents the data as the specified type, but does not alter the state of the operated object
	it simply presents it as a different class
	x <- 0:6
	as.numeric(x);
	as.logical(x);
	as.character(x);
	Coercion does not always work and NaN will be returned when it does not make sense
	
	list function()
	Different from vectors in that every element of a list could be an object of a different class
	elements of lists are indexed using the double brackets
	elements of other types of vector are indexed with only single brackets around them

Data Types : Matrices
	Special type of vector
	vectors that have a dimension attribute, vector of dimension 2, rows and columns
	m <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=6);
	attributes(m)
	matrix are constructed column-wise, first column gets filled before second column is started
	m <- matrix(1:6, nrow=5, ncol=6);
	can also convert a vector to a matrix by assigning the dim attribute to the number of 
	rows and columns in the vector data
	m <- 1:10
	dim(n) <- c(2,5)
	matrices can be created by binding columns or by binding rows
	x <- 1:3
	y <- 10:12
	cbind(x,y)
	rbind(x,y)
	Creates a matrix either with 3,2 rows and columns or 2,3 rows and columns
	
Factor
	Factor is a special type of vector for storing data that are either unordered, Male/Female
	or categorical and ordered, L, SL1, SL2, SL3
	Can deine High, Medium, Low, for example in an ordered Factor
	Factors are treated specially by modelling functions such as lm() and glm()
	Factors with labels better than integer variables.
	variable Male/Female better than just 1/2.
	
	x <-factor(c("yes","yes","no","no","no"))
	> x
		[1] yes yes no  no  no 
		Levels: no yes
	> table(x)
		x
		 no yes 
		  3   2 
	> unclass(x)
		[1] 2 2 1 1 1
		attr(,"levels")
		[1] "no"  "yes"


	Ordinarily "no" is baseline level, because "no" comes before "yes" in the alphabet
	We can set the order of the levels in the factor vector by specifying it upon creation
	f <- factor(c("yes","yes","no","no","yes"), levels = c("yes","no"))
	Useful if the factor variables are based on some sort of baseline level
	single:1 double:1
	
Missing Values 
	denoted by either NA or NaN
	is.na() tests objects to see if they are missing values
	is.nan() tests for NaNs
	NA values can also have a class, the missing object can also have a class
	a NaN is also a missing NA, but not vice versa
	
	> g <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
	> g
		[1]  1  2 NA  4  5
	> is.na(g)
		[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
		
	> g <- c(1, 2, NA, NaN, 5)
	> g
		[1]   1   2  NA NaN   5
	> is.na(g)
		[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
	> is.nan(g)
		[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
	
Data Frames
	Used to store Tabular Data
	Represented as a special type of list where every element has the same length
	Each column does not have to be same type
	Unlike Matrices which have to store the same types in each cel
	Every row can have a name rowname, but often we use 1,2,3
	read.table read.csv
	can also create a matrix from a  table by calling the matrix.table function
	forces coercion
	Dataframes can be created using the data.frame function
	specifying the column names
	> x <- data.frame(foo=1:4, bar=c(T,T,F,F));
	> x
		foo   bar
	1   1  TRUE
	2   2  TRUE
	3   3 FALSE
	4   4 FALSE
	> nrow(x)
		[1] 4
	> ncol(x)
		[1] 2

Names
	All R objects can also have names
	Very useful for writing readable code and self-derscribing objects
	> w <- 1:3
	> w
		[1] 1 2 3
	> names(w) <- c("foo","bar","norf");
	> w
		foo  bar norf 
		1    2    3 
	> names(w);
		[1] "foo"  "bar"  "norf"
	
	Lists can also have names
	
	> v <- list(a=1, b=2, c=4);
	> v
	$a
	[1] 1

	$b
	[1] 2

	$c
	[1] 4
	
	Matrices can have names
	> m <- matrix(1:4, nrow=2, ncol=2);
	> dimnames(m) <- list(c("r1", "row2"),c("col1","c2")); 
	> m
		 col1 c2
	r1      1  3
	row2    2  4

Data Types Summary
	atomic classes, numeric logical, character, integer and complex
	vectors, lists
	factors (ordered and unordered)
	missing values (NA and NaN)
	data frames
	names
	
Reading (and Writing) Tabular Data in R
		read.table
		read.csv
	read tabular data from text files and return a data frame in R

		readLines
	gives you text as a character vector in R
	can read any type of file
	
		source
	important for reading R code
		dget
	also reads R code files, for reading R objects that have been de=parsed into text files
	(does this mean serialized?)

		load and unserialize
	are for reading binary objects into R
	
	Analogous functions for writing are
		write.table
		writeLines
		dump
		dput
		save
		serialize
		
	read.table is the most commonly used function for reading data into R
	it takes some arguments
	file or connection
	header, indicating if first line is a header line
	sep is the separator string
	colClasses is a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset
		length the same as the number of columns in the data
	nrows
	comment.char character string indicating the comment character, default is #
	skip the number of lines at the start to skip
		useful for ignoring start data etc.
	stringsAsFactors defaults to true, do you want to encode character variables as factors
		R assumes you want to factorize this data.
		
	read.table
		data <- read.table("foo.txt");
	will automatically try to figure things out itself
	skip lines beginning with #
	figure out how many lines etc.
	Usually not much advantage to providing specific arguments in any case, as R will do
	pretty well in figuring this out itself
	read.csv is identical to read.table except that it uses the comma, by default as the separator.
	for read.table, the default separator is the space
	read.csv always specifies header=true by default

	
Reading Large Tables
	making your life a lot easier and prevent R from choking read the help page for read.Table
	memorize it even.
	A lot of important information there on how to optimize read.data particularly for large data sets
	In particular you will want to know how much memory you need to store the dataset you are about to read.
	R will try to store the entire dataset in physical memory
	If there are no comment lines in your file, just set the comment char to be an empty string
	Using the colClasses argument correctly will also help a lot.
	If you don't, then R will go through every column and try to figure out what kind of data it is.
	That's fine for small to moderate data sets and generally slows things down.
	Will make read.table run a lot faster if used correctly.
	Even if you give only a single value here, it will assume that every column has that same value
	Otherwise, you can read in the first 100 or 100 rows by specifying the nrows argument and 
	going through each of the columns using sapply to identify the derived classes for each column
	then save this and use it as the colClasses argument for read.table to save R from having to do
	so on the larger data sets.
		initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrows=100);
		classes <- sapply(initial, class);
		tabAll <- read.table("rataset.txt", colClasses=classes);
		
	you should also consider setting nrows. It does not help Ro to run any faster.
	A slight overestimate is ok, but it helps r to  decide how much memory to reserve for 
	the dataset. Using the unix tool we to count the lines in the file will help here.
	
	Knowing your own system, memory available, other applications in use
	etc...
	
	Calculating memory requirements

	1,500,000 rows and 120 columns, all columns are numeric
	1,500,000 x 120 x 8bytes (8 bytes for each numeric)
	1,373.20 MB
	1.34 GB
	
Textual data formats dput() and dump()
	produce text format versions of objects
	dump or dput will include in the output the class of the data in each column of the 
	data frame. Still a textual format, but also contains meta data.
	Produces somewhat less readable output, but saves the down-stream user from having 
	to re-engineer the data classes etc.
	Textual formats can be a lot more useful than binary formats as tools like git, etc
	can more readily track meaningful changes which can be done in text formats rather than
	binary data.
	Textual data also adheres to the UNIX philosophy of storing things by text by default 
	and whenever possible. The can be rather inefficient in terms of space usage.
	
	dput
	
	> y <- data.frame(a=1, b="a")
	> dput(y);
		structure(list(a = 1, 
						b = structure(1L, .Label = "a", class = "factor")),
						.Names = c("a", "b"), 
						row.names = c(NA, -1L), 
						class = "data.frame")
	> dput(y, file="y.R");
	> new.y <-dget("y.R");
	> new.y
		  a b
		1 1 a
	> y
		  a b
		1 1 a
		
	So, we can serialize the object y, using dput and then use dget to read it back in
	
	dump is a lot like dge
	dget can only be used on a single r obhect
	dump can be used on multiple r objects
	you can pass a character vector of the names of the objects if interest.
	
	> d <- "foo";
	> e <- data.frame(a=1, b="a");
	> dump(c("d", "e"), file="deData.R");
	> rm(d,e);
	> d
		Error: object 'd' not found
	> e
		Error: object 'e' not found
	> source("deData.R");
	> d
		[1] "foo"
	> e
 		  a b
		1 1 a
		
Connections: Interfaces to the Outside World
	We can interface between R and the outside world
	functions that are used to open up 'connections' to the outside world
	most commonly to a file, or a compressed file etc.
	when we do read.tabe from a file, the connection is done in the background
	you can also open up a connection to a web page using the url function
		file
		gzfile - compressed using gzip
	 	bzfile - compressed using bzip2
		url
	file arguments
		description  
		r, w, a, rb, wb, ab
	
	con <- file("foo.txt", "r");
	data <- read.csv(con);
	close(con);
		
	above is the same as doing read.csv on the file
	useful, though, of you only want to read parts from the file
	
	con <- gzfile("words.gz");
	x <- readLines(con, 10)
	reads 10 lines from the file words.gz
	
	writeLines takes a character vector argument which writes each element one line at a 
	time to a text file
	
	readLines can also be used to read lines from a web page
	> con <- url("http://www.jhsph.edu","r");
	> x <- readLines(con)
	> head(x);
		[1] "<!DOCTYPE html>"                                               
		[2] "<html lang=\"en\">"                                            
		[3] ""                                                              
		[4] "<head>"                                                        
		[5] "<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />"

Subsetting R Objects - Basics

	> y <- 2
	> x+y

Subsetting R Objects - Basics
	[
	[[
	$
	can all be used for subsetting
	[ - returns an object of the same class as the original, vector/vector list/list 
		can be used to select more than one elemenbt of an object (usually)
	[[ used to extract a single element of a list or a dataframe
		the returned object will not necessarily be an instance of list or dataframe
		lists can hold things of different classes, so [[ can return different class objects
	$ used to extract elements of a list or dataframe that has a name
		otherwise semantics are the same as [[
	
	example:
		> x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a");
		> x[1]
		[1] "a"
		> x[2]
		[1] "b"
		> x[1:4]
		[1] "a" "b" "c" "c"
		
	these are examples of using numeric index
	but we can also subset using a logical index
	
	so we can return a character vector that returns only those letters > a, for example
	> x[x>"a"]
		[1] "b" "c" "c" "d"
	
	we can create a logical vector, u, so that it is a true or false vector meeting the condition
	of being greater than a, for example. A bit like a select statement, where the SQL
	statement is the content of the logical vector
	
	> u<- x > "a"
	> u
		[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
	each of which match the statement x > "a", for the elements in the original vector x
	> x[u]
		[1] "b" "c" "c" "d"
	
	So we have used both a numeric index and a logical index
	
Subsetting R objects: lists
	a bit different from subsetting a vector
	> x <- list(foo=1:4, bar = 0.6);
	> x[1]
		$foo
		[1] 1 2 3 4
	> x$bar
		[1] 0.6
	> x[["bar"]]
		[1] 0.6
	> x["bar"]
	$bar
		[1] 0.6
		
	a list with two elements in it.
	[a] always returns an element with the same class as the original element
	so x[1] returns a list containing the sequence 1:4
	x[[1]] returns just the sequence 1:4
	
	subsetting an element using its name means we don't have to remember its numeric position
	
	To extract multiple elements of a list, we need to use the [ operator
	So, give me elements 1 and 3 of the original list
	> x <- list(foo=1:4, bar = 0.6, baz="hello");
	so, pass the numeric vector 1,3 to x using the single bracket operator
	which returns to me a list with elements foo and baz
	
	> x[c(1, 3)]
		$foo
		[1] 1 2 3 4

		$baz
		[1] "hello"
		
	[[ can be used to index a list where the index itself was computed
	sometimes the name of the element is the result of some computation
	so we can create a variable called name, and use that as the operator to
	the [[ operator
	
	> name <- "foo";
	> x[name]
		$foo
		[1] 1 2 3 4

	> x$name # name does not exist as a name, but only as a variable
		NULL
	> x$foo
		[1] 1 2 3 4

	[[ operator can take an integer sequence rather than just a single number.
	it recurses into the list, effectively 2-D indexing (double subsetting)
	
	> x <- list(a = list(10,12,14), b=c(3.14, 2.81))
	> x[[c(1,3)]] # element 3 of element 1
		[1] 14
	> x[[c(2,1)]] # element 1 of element 2
		[1] 3.14

Subsetting R objects: Matrices
	matrices can be subsetted in the usual way using the i,j notation
	> x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
	> x[1,2]
		[1] 3
	> x[2,1]
		[1] 2
	> x[1, ] # indices can also be missing, giving row 1
		[1] 1 3 5
	> x[ ,2] # or giving column 2
		[1] 3 4

	by default when a single element of a matrix is retrieved, is returned a vector of length 1
	rather than a 1x1 matrix.
	I don't get back a matrix, but an vector with just that element in it
	so x[1,2] returns a vector with element 1,2 in it, not a matrix 1x1 containing that element
	we can override this behaviouR with the drop=FALSE argument to the subsetting operation
	by default the subsetting drops the dimension, with drop=FALSE this is not done
	so we get a 2 dimensional object back, rather than the 1 dimensional object that
	would be returned by the drop=TRUE default behaviour
	> x[1,2]
		[1] 3
	> x[1,2, drop=FALSE];
		 [,1]
	[1,]    3
	
	when you subset a single column or a single row, you don't get back a matrix
	when you subset out the first row, you might expect a matrix 1x3 containing the 
	elements of the first row. That's not what you get
	you get back a vector containing the elements of the first row
	> x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
	> x[1, ]
		[1] 1 3 5
	> x[1, , drop=FALSE]
		 [,1] [,2] [,3]
	[1,]    1    3    5

Subsetting R objects: Subsetting with names
	Partial Matching - can save a lot of time at the command-line
	works with [[ and $ operators
	lets's just alias a to aardvark
	
	> x <- list(aardvark=1:5)
	> x$a
		[1] 1 2 3 4 5
	> x[["a"]]
		NULL
	> x[["a", exact = FALSE]]
		[1] 1 2 3 4 5
	
	[[ expects that the name will be an exact match, but we can suppress this by 
	specifying the exact=FALSE argument
	
Subsetting R objects, removing NA objects
	> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
	> bad <- is.na(x)
	> bad
		[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
	> x[bad]
		[1] NA NA
	> x[!bad]
		[1] 1 2 4 5

	Now, consider multiple objects, x and y, each of which have some missing values
	we can use complete.cases to create a vector containing logical values
	for complete cases, 
	TRUE if both are present, FALSE otherwise
	
	> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
	> y <- c("a", "b", NA, "d", NA, "f")
	> good <- complete.cases(x,y);
	> good
		[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
	> x[good]
		[1] 1 2 4 5
	> y[good]
		[1] "a" "b" "d" "f"

	you can also use complete cases to remove missing values from data frames
	in the following example, all we want are the rows where all values are non missing
	so, load the airquality data
	
	> airquality <- read.csv("hw1_data.csv");
	> airquality[1:6, ]

Vectorized operations
	Makes it easy to use on the command-line and write code without having to do 
	lots of looping
	things can happen in parallel over two vectors
	> x <- 1:4; y <-6:9
	> x+y
		[1]  7  9 11 13

	we can also do vectorized operations on boolean expressions and other arithmetic 
	expressions 
	> x >2
		[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
	> x >= 2
		[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
	> y ==8
		[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
	> x * y
		[1]  6 14 24 36
	> x / y
		[1] 0.1666667 0.2857143 0.3750000 0.4444444

	We can also apply vectorized operations to matrices
	> x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2); y <- matrix(rep(10,4), 2, 2)
	> x * y
 	    [,1] [,2]
	[1,]   10   30
	[2,]   20   40
	
	This is not MATRIX multiplication, simply element by element multiplication
	
	> x/y
	     [,1] [,2]
	[1,]  0.1  0.3
	[2,]  0.2  0.4

Repeat, Next, Break
	repeat requires a break that is guaranteed to occur at some time
	
Next, Return
	Next, to skip an iteration of a loop
	Return as in other languages, exit andreturn values

	add2 <- function(x, y) {
	  x + y
	}

	# function to return a vector of the elements of x (a vector) that are > 10
	above10 <- function(x)
	{
	  # this will return a logical vector, use, indicating whcih members of x are > 10 or an empty numberic
	  # vector, if there are ni elements above 10
		use <- x > 10
		x[use]
	}

	# function to return a vector of the elements of x (a vector) that are > a given number n
	# and uses a default value of n = 10
	above <- function(x, n = 10) 
	{
	  use <- x > n
	  x[use]

	# take a matrix or data frame and calculate the mean of each column
	# y is a data frame or a matrix

		means[i] <- mean(y[,i])
	  }
	  means;
	}
	
	
More on Functions
	Functions are R objects of class Function
	Functions are considered first-class objects, so they can be treated in the same
	way as any other first-class objects. Functions can also be defined within the scope of
	other functions. The implications of this are discussed in Lexical Scoping
	The return value of a function is the value of the last expression to be evaluated
	within an R function
	
	Arguments. Named arguments can have default values.
	Formal arguments are those that are included in the function definition
	The formals() function returns a list of all the formal arguments of a function
	Not every function call makes use of all the formal arguments
	Function arguments may be missing or might have default values if they have not been
	specified by the user.
	Function arguments can be matched by position or by name
	 sd()
	calculates the standard deviation
	Arguments can be specified based on position, or by name
	You can mix positional arguments and named arguments
	this allows you to mess around with the order of arguments, but why bother?
	
	> mydata <- rnorm(100)
	> sd(mydata)
		[1] 1.154282
	> sd(x = mydata)
		[1] 1.154282
	> sd(x = mydata, na.rm=FALSE)
		[1] 1.154282
	> sd(na.rm=FALSE, x = mydata)
		[1] 1.154282
	> sd(na.rm=FALSE, mydata)
		[1] 1.154282

	args(lm)
	function (formula, data, subset, weights, na.action, method = "qr", 
   	 model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE, singular.ok = TRUE, 
   	 contrasts = NULL, offset, ...) 


Argument matching. On the command-line, named arguments are very useful, particularly
	if you want to call arguments by name other than the ones that are to take
	default arguments.
	Also very useful for plotting, as these functions often have a very long argument
	list
	
	Function name matching also works. You can provide a partial match for an argument name
	and as long as the short name supplied is unique, then R will do a partial match
	If exact name does not match, R will look for a partial match, and if that does not work
	R will look for a positional match
	
	In addition to not specifying a default value you can also set an argument value to NULL

R includes lazy evaluation.
	This means that the arguments to a function are only evaluated as they are needed
	If the function uses, for example, only the first argument, and the second is not used,
	then the function does not use the second argument, does not evaluate it, and 
	R does not complain about the missing argument which was never used
	
	In the following example, R does not complain
	
	f2 <- function(a,b)
	{
	  a^2
	}

	# but in this case, R does complain, but only after the print(a) call
	f3 <- function(a, b)
	{
	  print(a)
	  print(b)
	}
		[1] 45
		Error in print(b) : argument "b" is missing, with no default
	
The ... argument
	Used when extending another function and you don't want to copy across
	all the arguments used in the first function.
	So, in the following example, myplot can be called with all the same arguments that 
	we expect in a call to plot, but we don't have to specify them explicitly.
	
	myplot <- function(x, y, type = "1", ...)
	{
		plot(x,y, type = type, ...);
	}

Generic functions use ... so that extra arguments can be passed to methods
	> mean
	function (x, ...)
	UseMethod("mean")
	
	the .. argument is necessary when the number of arguments passed to a function cannot
	be known in advance
	One good example would be in the paste function which concatenates a vector of strings
	it can take a variable number of arguments, the number of whcih cannot be known in 
	advance.
	
	> args(paste)
	function (..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL) 
	
	> args(cat)
	function (..., file = "", sep = " ", fill = FALSE, labels = NULL, 
		append = FALSE) 
		
	Cat pastes together a number of strings(like cat in UNIX/Linux/Mac OSX)
	One catch with ... is that any arguments that appear after the ... on the 
	argument list must be named explicitly and cannot be partially matched.
	You cannot use positional matching or partial matching for the arguments that come 
	after the ...
	Otherwise there is no way for R to know if you are passing something onwards via the 
	... or passing something as a different argument
	
	This can lead to unexpected results, so be careful when using
	..., partial matching etc.
	
Scoping Rules, Symbol Binding
	How does R assign a value to a symbol from within a function
	Example of function lm, which already exists in R
	Is it the existing or the new declaration that is used
	
	R searches through a number of environments, which are lists of symbols and values
	search the global environment, for the requested symbol
	If there is a symbol found, it will take that symbol first
	
	If there is no match in the global environment, then R will search the namespaces of 
	the packages that are loaded
	
	search()
	 [1] ".GlobalEnv"        "tools:rstudio"     "package:stats"     "package:graphics"  "package:grDevices"
 	[6] "package:utils"     "package:datasets"  "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base"     
	
	somewhere on this list, R is going to look for a function called lm (linear models)
	.GlobalEnv is equivalent to the user's workspace.
	The order of packages matters, and the users can specify the order in which packages
	get loaded when they start up, so you cannot assume
	that a symbol will always match to the same thing.
	
	When a user loads a package with the library call, the namespace of that package
	gets put in position 2 of the search list (immediately after .GlobalEnv).
	and everything else gets pushed down one place on the list
	
	R has separate namespaces for functions and non-functions, so it is possible to have
	an object names c and a function also named c

Scoping Rules
	Determine how a value is bound to a free variabel in a function
	R uses lexical scoping or static scoping
	A common alternative is dynamic scoping
	Lexical scoping turns out to be particularly valuable for simplifying statistical 
	calculations
	
	In the following, z is a free variable, since it was not specified in the declaration 
	of the function
	
	f4 <- function(x, y) 
	{
 	 x^2 + y^2 / z
	}
	
Lexical scoping Rules
	The valuables of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the 
	function was defined
	An environment is a collection of (symbol, value) pairs
	x and 3.14
	Every environment has a parent environment, and it is possible for a parent to have 
	multiple children
	
	The only environment without a parent is the empty environment
	a function + an environment = a closure or a function closure
	
	These function closures are the key to a lot of interesting operations in R
	
	Searching for the value of a free variable
	First, look for the environment in which the function was defined
	That is the parent environment.
	If I can't find something in that environment, the search continues in the parent
	of that environment
	
	The search continues through the list of parent environments until we find the value 
	for this free variable. This continues until we hit the top-level environment
	Usually this is the .Global environment (workspace) or the namespace of a package
	After the top-level environment, we continue down the search list until we hit the 
	empty environment. If a value for a given symbol cannot be found once the empty 
	environment is reached, then an error is thrown saying a value cannot be found for that 
	symbol
	
	I'm going to skip the rest of this, as I feel it has more to do with Compiler design 
	than with the use of the R programming language.
	
Coding Standards in  R
	Some basic minimal standard when coding in R:
		Always write and save using text editor. 
		Indentation
		Limit the width of your code
		Using preferences to change indentation
		Limit the length of functions. Keep them simple by doing only one basic activity
		This enhances both readability and modularity
		This also assists debugging and traceback by examining the function stack
		
Dates and Times in R:
	R has a special way to represent dates and times, using special classes.
	Dates are represented by the Date class
	Times are represented by the POSIXct and the POSIXlt classes
	Dates are stored internally as number of days since 1st January 1970
	Times are stored internally as number of seconds since 1st January 1970
	
	x <- as.Date("1970-01-01"); # as YYYY-MM-DD
	> x;
		[1] "1970-01-01"
	> unclass(x);
		[1] 0
	> unclass(as.Date("1970-01-02"))
		[1] 1
	
	POSIX - Family of Computing Standards (based on UNIX)
	POSIXct, times are represented as very large integers.
	Useful for storing dates, for example, in a Data Frame, makes more efficient use of space
	POSIXlt, Stores time as a list, including a bunch of other useful information, day 
	of week, etc... day of the year or month, month itself
	Generic functions that operate on dates and times 
	weekdays() gives the day of the week
	months() gives the month names
	quarters() gives the quarter numbers "Q1", Q2, Q3, Q4
	These generic functions operate on instances of class POSIXct, POSIXlt or Date
	
	x <- Sys.time();
	> x
		[1] "2015-08-17 11:11:12 IST"
	> p <- as.POSIXlt(x);
	> names(unclass(p));
		[1] "sec"    "min"    "hour"   "mday"   "mon"    "year"   "wday"   "yday"   "isdst"  "zone"   "gmtoff"
	> p$sec
		[1] 12.93365
	
	strptime() function converts dates writte in character string format into date or time objects
	these use format strings
	
	dateString <- c("January 10, 2012 10:40", "December 14, 2015 11:15");
	> datestring;
		[1] "January 10, 2012 10:40"  "December 14, 2015 11:15"
	> x <- strptime(dateString, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M");
	> x;
		[1] "2012-01-10 10:40:00 GMT" "2015-12-14 11:15:00 GMT"
	> class(x);
		[1] "POSIXlt" "POSIXt" 
	You don't need to remember all of these, look them up using help(strptime)
	
	Once you have them in one of the date/time formats, you can compare and operate on them
	add, subtract, compare etc..
	x <- as.Date("2012-01-01");
	> y <- strptime("09 Jan 2011 11:23:45", "%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S")
	> x <- as.POSIXlt(x);
	> x-y
		Time difference of 356.5252 days
		
	Date/Time operators keep track of very tricky things like leap years, 
	leap seconds, daylight savings time, etc...
		
	x <- as.Date("2012-02-28");
	> y <- as.Date("2012-03-01");
	> y-x
		Time difference of 2 days
		
	x<- as.POSIXct("2012-03-01 04:00", tz="GMT")
	> y<- as.POSIXct("2012-03-01 04:00", tz="EST")
	> x-y
		Time difference of -5 hours
	
	Many of the plot functions recognise date/time functions
	
Week 3
	Loop functions are very useful particularly in the interactive setting
	they usually have the word  apply in the somewhere
	lapply, tapply, mapply, sapply, apply
		lapply() loop over a list
		sapply() loop over a list, but try to simplify the output
		apply() apply a function over the margins(?) of an array
		tapply() apply a function over a vector
		mapply() multivariate(?) version of apply
	an associated function split() is also useful, particularly in conjunction
	with lapply()
	
	lapply() applies over a list of objects and apply a function to every
	element of that list
	
	takes three arguments, a list, a function name, and other arguments via ... 
	to be passed to the function
	if x is not a list, it will be coerced to a list. If it is not possible to 
	coerce it to a list, this will throw an error
	
	The looping is done internally in C code (to make it faster)
	
	List can contain any number of different types of objects
	The function will return something for every single objects in that list
	and the returned objects will be assembled into a list
	
	x <- list(a = 1:5, b = rnorm(10));
	> lapply(x,mean);
	$a
		[1] 3
	$b
		[1] 0.1031459

	What comes out will always be a list
	In this case, the output list is the mean of each of the constituent elements
	in the input list
	
	x <- list(a = 1:4, b = rnorm(10), c=rnorm(20,1), d=rnorm(100,5));
	> lapply(x,mean);

	# in vectors if size 1, 2, 3 and 4, using a uniform distribution between
	0 (default value) and 1 (default value)

	# or, we would generate random variables in the range 0 - 10
	# then we need to pass some arguments to the runif function which are not
	# the default values

	Anonymous Functions - functions that don't have names
	lapply() and others make heavy use of anonymous functions
	(inner functions)
	
	> x <- list(a=matrix(1:4, 2, 2), b=matrix(1:6,3,2));
	> x
	$a
    		 [,1] [,2]
		[1,]    1    3
		[2,]    2    4
	$b
    		 [,1] [,2]
		[1,]    1    4
		[2,]    2    5
		[3,]    3    6

	> lapply(x, function(elt) elt[,1]);
	$a
		[1] 1 2
	$b
	[1] 1 2 3
	
	sapply() is just a variant of lapply that tries to simplify the output of lapply
	lapply always returns a list, but sometimes you don't want a list
	if the result is a list where element is a list of length 1
	sapply will simplify that into a vector
	if lapply would have returned a list of elements, each of which was the same length,
	say 5, then instead of a list of list objects, sapply will return a single matrix
	of width 5
	if it cannot figure out how to simplify it, it will just return the same list
	as lapply would have returned.
	
	in the case of an earlier example, the out is provided as a list of lists
	we would like a list of elements
	> x <- list(a = 1:4, b = rnorm(10), c=rnorm(20,1), d=rnorm(100,5));
	> lapply(x,mean);
	$a

Loop functions:
	apply function
	"over the margins of an array" 
	Usually used to apply a function to the rows or columns of an array, 
	may be matrices, or 3-d arrays etc.
	Such, as taking the average of a list of matrices for example
	Some say using apply is faster or better, but not true.
	It just involves less typing.
	Very useful in the command-line doing exploratory analysis
	
	first argument x is an array ( a vector that has dimensions attached)
	a MARGIN is an integer vector which indicates which margins should be retained
	fun is the applied function to be applied to the MARGINS

	# This calculates the mean of each column of the matrix
	# the following matrix has two dimensions
	# dimension 1 has 20 rows and dimension 2 has 10 columns
	x <- matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10)

	# when you apply the funciton mean over the matrix, you want to keep the second dimension (10 columns)
	# and you want to collapse the first dimension (20 columns)
	# so the following will generate a vector of length 10
	apply(x,2,mean);

	# and you want to collapse the second dimension (10 columns)

	For simple operations, there are special functions
	For example, calculating the sum or mean of a column or a row etc

	gives us 20 x 25th percentile and 20 x 75th percentile for each of the 20 columns (which I want to keep)
	goes through each row and calculates 25th and 75th percentile
	Will create a matrix 2x20 with 2 rows and 20 coulmns
	
	Suppose I had more than a Matrix, an array, two rows and two columns and depth 10
	2x2 matrices, 10 of them
	I want to take the average of each of these
	I want to keep the first and second dimensions, but collapse the third
	so,

	# we gave a vector 1,2 as an argument, so we collapsed 3 and left 1 and 2 intact
	We can also use rowmeans using dims=2 as an argument
	
	mapply is a multivariate version of lappy and sapply functions
	applies a function in parallel over a set of different arguments
	lappy, sapply, tapply only apply over the elements of a single object
	If you have the elemtns of 2 lists as the arguments, then mapply is used
	to take the elements of list 1 as one argument and elements of list 2 as the other.
	So, mapply can take many lists as arguments.
	so, the first argument is the function you wish to apply
	has to have be at least as many as the number of lists you are going to pass to mapply
	so the lists will be passed through the... argument to the function
	The simplify argument is the same as in sapply
	
	So, we create a list 1,2,3,4
	> a <- list(rep(1,4), rep(2,3), rep(3,2), r .... [TRUNCATED] 
	> # or we could use mapply, by supplying the correct arguments
	> # since we are repeatedly calling the rep function with
	> # different arguments

Loop functions: tapply
	Used to apply function over subsets of a vector
	You are going to have another object to identify which elements of the numeric
	vector represents a group
	first argument is a numeric (or other vector) second vector identifies to which 
	group each element of the first vector belongs
	fun is the function you want to apply, or an anonymous function and then ... arguments
	simplify indicates whether you want to simplify the result
	ten normal variables, ten uniform variables, and ten normals having a mean of 1

	> x <- c(rnorm(10), runif(10), rnorm(10,1));
	> f <- gl(3,10);

Loop Functions, split
	tapply splits a vector into little pieces and applies a summary function 
	to those pieces, and then brings those pieces back together again.
	split splits a vector into pieces determined by a factor or a list of factors.
	x is a vector
	f is a factor (or coerced to one, or a list of factors)
	drop indicates whether empty factors levels should be dropped
	
	very handy for use in conjunction with lapply and mapply etc.

	USing split to split the x vector, and then take the output and send it to 
	lapply with function mean
	
	This could also be done directly using the tapply function, but this offers 
	an option
	
	Split can be used to split much more complex types of objects than would be 
	the case with the tapply function directly

	Split is a very powerful function for splitting a vector according to
	the contents of a factor, and then applying a function across those
	partial-vectors. 
	
Splitting on more than one level.
	So far, we have split only on one dimension;
	What if we want to split based on several factors. 
	Say, gender and race


	> x  <- rnorm(10);
	> f1 <- gl(2,5); # 2 levels, 5 times
	> f2 <- gl(5,2); # 5 levels, 2 times
	> interaction(f1, f2);
		 [1] 1.1 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 2.3 2.4 2.4 2.5 2.5
		Levels: 1.1 2.1 1.2 2.2 1.3 2.3 1.4 2.4 1.5 2.5
		(we will see later that there are empty levels in this interaction)
		2.1, 2.1, 1.4, 1.5 do not exist in the top array
		
	Total combination of 10 different levels.
	Interaction prints out a total of 10 levels
	
	Now we can split the numeric vector, x, according to the two factors
	we don't have to call the interaction function, that will be called
	automatically for us.
	
	> str(split(x, list(f1, f2)));
		List of 10
		 $ 1.1: num [1:2] 1.154 0.783
		 $ 2.1: num(0) 
		 $ 1.2: num [1:2] -1.1594 -0.0932
		 $ 2.2: num(0) 
		 $ 1.3: num 0.623
		 $ 2.3: num 0.819
		 $ 1.4: num(0) 
		 $ 2.4: num [1:2] -1.189 -0.114
		 $ 1.5: num(0) 
		 $ 2.5: num [1:2] 0.0129 -0.3515
	
	Just pass a list with the two factors, f1 and f2
	Returns a list with the levels of the 10 different interaction factors
	There are some empty levels, with zero elements in them.
	We could take that list and lapply or sapply over it, or we could
	drop the empty levels by using the drop=TRUE argument
	
	> str(split(x, list(f1, f2),drop=TRUE));
		List of 6
		 $ 1.1: num [1:2] -0.783 -0.879
		 $ 1.2: num [1:2] 1.1427 0.0465

Debugging tools (built-in part of R)
	Message, Warning, Error, Condition,
	These may indicate that something is wrong
	Warning: something unexpected happened, not enough to kill the whole thing
	Error: Fatal problem, stops execution of the function
	Condition: All three of the above are conditions. You can create your own
	condition classes
	
	Warning:
	log(-1);
		[1] NaN
		Warning message:
		In log(-1) : NaNs produced
	
	Aside: In the following code, invisible prevents autoprinting, which is the 
	printing of the last value returned by the function.
	Calling the function causes the object to be returned, but not printed 
	as is automatically the case.
	All print functions actually return the object that got printed.
	So you could assigned the output of a print statement to an object.
	
	So, our function does not know how to handle NA, so it will throw an error
	> printmessage(1);
		[1] "x is greater than zero"
	> printmessage(0);
		[1] "x is less than or equal to zero"
	> printmessage(-2);
		[1] "x is less than or equal to zero"
	> printmessage(NA);
		Error in if (x > 0) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

	We can fix this by handling the NA value
	> printmessage(log(-1));
		[1] "x is a missing value!"
		Warning message:
		In log(-1) : NaNs produced
		
	Questions:
		Is it coder error, or user error?
		What WAS your input? How did you call the function?
		What were you expecting? Output messages, other results?
			I was expecting this (was that correct), I got that (was that correct?)
		What did you get?
		How does what you got differ from what you were expecting?
		Were your expectations correct in the first place?
		Can you reproduce the problem?
		
Debugging tools in R
	traceback: prints the function stack
	debug: flags a function for debug mode, by allowing you to step through it
	browser: suspends the execution of a function whenever it is called and puts the 
		function in debug mode, similar to debug, but occurs later in the function
		like a breakpoint
	trace: allows you to insert debugging code into a function at specific places.
		Allows you to edit the behaviour of the function without modifying its code, 
		to which we may not have access
	recover: allows you to modify the error behaviour so that you can browse the 
		function call stack. Recover allows you to resume execution, to override the 
		fact that an error caused the function to halt. For use with error 
		handlers.
	Of course, the usual print and cat functions will also help.
	Some people argue that over-reliance on the debugger causes sloppy coding habits
	That some people would just code it and let it fail, then use the debugger to sort it out.
	
Debugging examples
	
	> mean(xyz)
		Error in mean(xyz) : object 'xyz' not found
	> traceback()
		1: mean(xyz)
	
A more complex example	
	> lm(y-x)
		Error in formula.default(object, env = baseenv()) : invalid formula
		In addition: Warning message:
		In Ops.factor(y, x) : ‘-’ not meaningful for factors
	> traceback()
		9: stop("invalid formula")
		8: formula.default(object, env = baseenv())
		7: formula(object, env = baseenv())
		6: as.formula(formula)
		5: model.frame.default(formula = y - x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
		4: stats::model.frame(formula = y - x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
		3: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
		2: eval(mf, parent.frame())
		1: lm(y - x)

	This shows us that at the 7th level, the error occurred.
	
	Debug function does not really work well in the static format, but this example
	illustrates it in any case
	
	> debug(lm)
	> lm(y - x)
	debugging in: lm(y - x)
	debug: {
 	   ret.x <- x
 		...
		...
		...
		z$qr <- NULL
 		z
	}
	
	You can debug any function, whether you wrote it or not. 
	It will print out the entire function body code
	the a browse prompt.
	You are now in the browser
	This is just like the workspace, an embedded workspace.
	The environment of that browser is what is in the environment of the function
	
	n <cr> causes the next line to be executed, and the code environment to be
	highlighted above
	
	You can further debug function calls from within the browser, bringing you to
	a third level in the browser.
	
	debug(<function about to be called>)
	n <cr>
	So we can nest debug calls
	
	Recover: you can set the global option to be to recover
	This presents you with a menu of options, traceback, 
	read.csv is a wrapper for read.table which calls file()
	so, error occurred at the third level, so you can step into the function calls
	before where the error occurred, to see what caused the ultimate function 
	call to fail.

	This gives us a list of 5 different data frames
	Each data frame gives us data for a given month
	The data are only collected over 5 different months.
	September, for example, is as follows
	 $ 9:'data.frame':	30 obs. of  6 variables:
	  ..$ Ozone  : int [1:30] 96 78 73 91 47 32 20 23 21 24 ...

Sumulation
	rnorm - simulate normal random variables
	dnorm - evalueate the Normal probability density
	pnorm - evaluates the comulative distribution for a Normal distribution
	rpois - generates poissin random variables.
	
	Probability functions nusually have four functions associated with them
	The functions are prefixed with the following:
	
	d for density
	r random
	p cumulative distribution
	q quantile
	
	dnorm
	pnorm
	qnorm
	rnorm
	
	All required that you specify the mean and the standard deviation, default values are 
	mean 0 and std dev 1
	
	There is an option to allow you to evaluate the log og the density for a standard normal 
	distribution
	
	lower tail is the default
	if you want to evaluate the upper tail, use lower-tail=FALSE
	
	if phi is the cumulative distribtion function for a standard Normal distribution, 
	then pnorm(q) = phi(q) and qnorm = phi^-1(p) , the inverse of phi
	
	If you want to generate some random normal variance
	x <- rnorm(10);
	x
	y <- rnorm(10, 20, 2)
	y
	summary(y)

	Anytime you simulate random numbers from any distribution for any puropse, it is very
	important to set the random number generateor seed.
	Random number are not random, but they appear random.
	If we re-set the seed the same random numbers will be generated again.
	So, you can reproduce the random numbers that you generated by forcing the seed
	back to a given value.
	
	In addition to normal distributions, we can also generate random variables
	from other distributions, including from poisson distribution.
	rpois(10,1)
	# poisson data will be integer.
	x <- rpois(10,1);
	print(x);
	y <- rpois(10, 20);
	print(y);

	# what's the proability that a poisson distribution random variable is < 2, if the rate is 2.
	z <- ppois(2,2);

	print(z);
	v <- ppois(4,2);
	print(v);
	w <- ppois(6,2);
	print(w);

Simulating a linear model.
	Generating random numbers from a simple probability distribution
	what if you wanted to simulate data from a model, such as, for example,a linear model.
	linear model, single preduictor x, randome noise epsilon with normal distribution and standard 
	deviation 2
	b0 = 0.5 b1=2

	set.seed(20);
	x <- rnorm(100);
	e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
	y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e;
	summary(y);
	plot(x, y);
		
	set.seed(10);
	x <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5);
	e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2)
	y <- 0.5 + 2 *x + e
	summary(y)
	plot(x,y);
	
	can generate binary data using the binomial distribution
	100 random variables.
	p1 = 0.5, p0 = 0.1
	x variable is binary, but y varibale is still continuous, it is normal
	So a linear trend.
	
	A more complicaed model.
	
	Simulate some outcome data that are count variables instead of continous variables.
	Slightly more complicated approach.
	Because the error distribution is nor going to be a normal distribution, but a
	poisson distribution
	
	set.seed(1);
	x <- rnorm(100);
	log.mu <- 0.5 +0.3 * x
	y <- rpois(100, exp(log.mu));
	summary(y)
	plot(x,y);
