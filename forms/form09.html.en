<h2>HTML5 &lt;keygen&gt; Element</h2>
The purpose of the &lt;keygen&gt; element is to provide a secure way to authenticate users.
<br>
The keygen element specifies a key-pair generator field in a form.
<br>
When the form is submitted, two keys are generated, one private and one public.
<br>
The private key is stored locally, and the public key is sent to the server.
<br>
The public key could be used to generate a client certificate to authenticate the user
in the future.
